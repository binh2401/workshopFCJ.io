In the context of a strong digital transformation, consumer behavior is shifting toward prioritizing online shopping to save time and enhance user experience. Building an online bookstore system not only meets the demand for quick and convenient book searching and purchasing but also contributes to market expansion for publishers.

The project **"Building an Online Bookstore Website"** is implemented with the goal of creating a specialized e-commerce platform for books, providing features from book browsing, searching, and ordering to product and user management.

In particular, the project integrates modern technologies such as:

- **ASP.NET MVC** as the development framework for both backend and frontend,  
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** to deploy the system on cloud infrastructure,  
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to suggest books tailored to user behavior through **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)** and **Amazon Neptune ML**.

The system goes beyond a basic web application by aiming for scalable flexibility, high security, and efficient performance on the cloud platform. This lays the foundation for real-world deployment or future commercialization.
